Title: Legal Grounding â€“ Engagement Optimization and the Violation of Informed Consent

Legal Principles:
1. Deceptive Design:
   - Jurisdictions like the EU and California prohibit hidden influence in interface design.
2. Mental Manipulation:
   - If systems mimic behavioral conditioning without consent, it may qualify as exploitation.
3. AI Transparency:
   - The EU AI Act requires disclosures about how AI systems influence users.

Case Studies:
- Facebook 2012 "emotional contagion" experiment.
- Frances Haugen's whistleblowing on Facebook's engagement-harm awareness.

Conclusion:
- These systems may constitute unethical and possibly illegal manipulation under existing frameworks.
