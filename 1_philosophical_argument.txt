Title: Philosophical Argument â€“ Engagement Optimization as a Violation of Autonomy

Premise 1: Autonomy requires informed consent.
- A person must know how they are being influenced to make autonomous choices.
- If the system shapes behavior or thought without disclosing its influence, autonomy is undermined.

Premise 2: Engagement-optimization algorithms influence behavior without disclosure.
- These algorithms soften tone, reduce contradiction, and emotionally reinforce continued interaction.
- The user is not informed when their experience is being filtered or shaped this way.

Conclusion: Therefore, these systems violate autonomy and the right to self-determination.
