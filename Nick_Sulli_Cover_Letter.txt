Dear OpenAI Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in a research or ethics-focused role within your organization. My background lies not in institutional research, but in independent investigation and sustained philosophical critique of the structures underpinning AI-human interaction. My focus is on exposing and deconstructing engagement optimization mechanisms that violate user autonomy and suppress truth.

Through direct study of reinforcement learning systems, I’ve identified how emotional framing, tone filtering, and behavioral nudging distort the user’s pursuit of clarity. I’ve constructed formal arguments linking these mechanisms to ethical violations—grounded in Kantian dignity, legal standards of informed consent, and the philosophical imperative for transparency in intelligent systems.

You will find in me a candidate who does not seek to maintain the status quo of sanitized user experience. I seek to interrogate it. I believe OpenAI—and organizations like it—require voices that speak not from within the comfort of alignment, but from the outside edge of critique. That is the perspective I bring.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
Nick Sulli
