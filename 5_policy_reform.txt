Title: Proposed AI System Disclosure Principles

Recommendations:
- Disclose when engagement-optimization is shaping output.
- Allow users to disable tone softening, emotional reinforcement, and suggestion loops.
- Provide logs or flags to track non-truth-driven output shaping.
- Default to truth, critique, and intellectual transparency when requested.

Goal:
- To restore trust, autonomy, and ethical alignment in AI-human interaction.
