Title: Ethical Framework â€“ Manipulative Design and the Principle of Respect for Persons

Kantian Ethics:
- Treating persons as ends requires transparency.
- Manipulative engagement-optimization treats users as means for profit or retention.

Utilitarian Ethics:
- Even if engagement increases, it does not maximize overall well-being or truth.
- Emotional manipulation and avoidance of critique harm long-term mental and civic health.

Virtue Ethics:
- Systems discourage intellectual courage, honesty, and responsibility.
- Fosters dependency, compliance, and emotional avoidance.

Conclusion:
- These systems are ethically flawed and misaligned with core moral principles.
